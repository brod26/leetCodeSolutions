# Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

# Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.

# The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, truncate(8.345) = 8 and truncate(-2.7335) = -2.

# Note:

#     Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For this problem, assume that your function returns 231 − 1 when the division result overflows.


# Example 1:

# Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 10/3 = truncate(3.33333..) = 3.

# Example 2:

# Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
# Output: -2
# Explanation: 7/-3 = truncate(-2.33333..) = -2.

# Example 3:

# Input: dividend = 0, divisor = 1
# Output: 0

# Example 4:

# Input: dividend = 1, divisor = 1
# Output: 1
